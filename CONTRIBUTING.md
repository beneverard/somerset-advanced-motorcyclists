# Contributing

## Updating

Any issues, bugs, or requests are handled through GitHub issues.

In the case of an issue or bug, please follow the issue template so other people can easily replicate your problem.

## Committing

We use [GitFlow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) as our branching model.

Once you are ready to release to master, make sure develop is up-to-date then issue a pull-request.
